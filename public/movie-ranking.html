<h1>The best movies according to Thure</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Kolja</h3>
<p>This is a lovely movie about the relationship of a boy to a grown man in prague,
     which might be my dream city</p>
<h3>Shawshank redemption</h3>
<p>I also liked this movie a lot, because it has a really beautiful ending, and most of the characters develop really nicely.</p>
<h3>Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi</h3>
<p>When I was a child, I was used to watching this movie every half year or so, simply because it has the best actors and the best music that was ever used in a movie I watched.</p>
